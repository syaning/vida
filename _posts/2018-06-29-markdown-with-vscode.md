Some of the plugins I use to be more productive writing markdown files in Visual Studio Code

## [Markdown Preview Github Styling](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles)

My preferred markdown file preview plugin, the interesting thing is that the preview is very much like the README.md files we see in projects on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/), so the file need not be in the [GitHub](http://www.github.com/) to see the result.

Launch Visual Studio Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following command, and press enter.

```ext install bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles```

### How to Use

Use the following shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+V` or `Ctrl+K+V` to open preview to the side.

## markdownlint

markdownlint Check if you're writing the *right way*, making your text beautiful, easy to read and write XD.
