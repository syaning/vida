Hello! My name is João Thallis, I'm a Software Developer. I live in [Rio de Janeiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro_(state)) and my favorite programming language is Elixir.

I believe that 2 wonderful ways to learn something is teaching (for this I created [this blog](https://joaothallis.github.io/) to show) and creating (for this I keep some projects in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/joaothallis)).

I am interested in open source projects, Linux, game development, functional programming (*Elixir*, *Erlang*), domain-driven design, software architecture, clean code, productivity and agile development, business, finances and entrepreneurship.

I am also a student of Computing at [*Fluminense Federal University*](http://www.uff.br/).

This site has open source, you can make a fork and create your own site/blog from it, if you have any suggestion of improvement you can [open a issue](https://github.com/joaothallis/joaothallis.github.io/issues/new) in the Github of that [project](https://joaothallis.github.io/).

You can find me on a variety of sites where my username is usually `joaothallis` or `João Thallis`
