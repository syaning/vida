My name is João Thallis, I'm a Software Developer. I live in Rio de Janeiro - Brazil and my favorite language is Elixir.

I love open source, learning about productivity, business, entrepreneurship and I also really enjoy teaching what I'm learning (One of the reasons I create this blog).

I am also a student of Computing at Fluminense Federal University.
