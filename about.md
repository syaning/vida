My name is João Thallis, I'm a Software Developer. I live in Rio de Janeiro - Brazil and my favorite programming language is Elixir.

I believe that 2 wonderful ways to learn something is teaching (for this I created this blog to show) and creating (for this I keep some projects in my GitHub profile).

I love open source, Linux, programming, productivity, business, finances and entrepreneurship.

I am also a student of Computing at Fluminense Federal University.
